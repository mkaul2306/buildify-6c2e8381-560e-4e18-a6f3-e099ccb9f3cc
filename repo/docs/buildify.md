# Analytics Dashboard Project Plan

## Requirements
- Build a lightweight, fast, and modern internal analytics web application for visualizing and monitoring data
- Primary focus on user attachment management analytics
- Display key metrics: number of attachments, types, upload success/failures, storage usage, user activity
- Include visualizations: charts (bar, line, pie), tables, and key metric cards
- No authentication required initially (security via deployment/network controls)
- Non-technical user friendly with admin controls
- Optimize for performance, maintainability, and cost efficiency
- Design for scalability to easily add new charts/dashboards and data sources

## Design
- Modern, clean React application with responsive layout
- Supabase backend with PostgreSQL database
- Dashboard with multiple visualization components:
  - Summary metrics cards
  - Time-series charts for trends
  - Distribution charts for file types
  - Data tables for detailed information
- Filter controls for time periods and data segmentation
- Modular component architecture for easy extension
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet viewing
